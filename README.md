## ðŸ“‹ Description

We decided to make game related mainly to chemistry and the reactions we learn in school. The general idea of the game is that a chemistry scientist tried to become one of the best scientists but during one of his dangerous experiments he made a mistake and the laboratory was destroyed. Now 3 years later you help him to clear his name and he help you to become great chemistry scientist. You can obtain chemical element by buying them for the shop or finding them in the form of junk and purifying them. You task is to make different reactions and get all the elements in the game and unlock achievements.
